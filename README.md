The provided Java code represents a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for an ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) system. 

It uses Swing, which is a Java GUI toolkit, to create a window with a button to open an image, and it displays a static number plate string for demonstration purposes. Let's go through the code in detail


ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is a cutting-edge technology that integrates sophisticated image processing algorithms and advanced character recognition techniques to automatically detect and extract number plates from images or video frames.

Its application spans multiple industries, including traffic management, law enforcement, parking systems, toll collection, and more, where it significantly improves operational efficiency, enhances accuracy, and enhances security measures.
